# Create files and directories for testing (optional setup)
# -p option: This flag stands for "parents" and allows mkdir to create the specified directory and any necessary parent directories. If the directory already exists, it will not produce an error.
# ln: This command is used to create links (either hard or symbolic) to files.
# -s option: This flag stands for "symbolic". It tells ln to create a symbolic (or soft) link, which is a reference to another file or directory. A symbolic link works like a shortcut in a file system.
# ln -s - is useful for version management, creating shortcuts, or managing resources across different locations. Itâ€™s common for managing configuration files, libraries, or data across multiple systems or services.
